# NLP--Natural-Language-Processing
In this project, the goal was to classify messages into two categories: spam and ham (non-spam). The dataset consisted of a collection of labeled messages, where each message was categorized as either spam or ham.
Feature extraction was carried out by converting the cleaned text into a structured numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
A key aspect of the analysis was generating word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in spam and ham messages. The word clouds helped in identifying distinct patterns and word usage differences between the two categories.

Conclusion: The project demonstrated the ability of Logistic Regression to effectively classify messages into spam and ham categories based on textual features. The model was able to achieve a reasonable level of accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes, with clear differences in the word usage patterns observed in the word clouds.
